# Demographic-Health-Risk-Analysis

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present a visualization of pre-selected census data from each state within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, D3 was used to import and process the data, as well as generate the required visualization.

## Questions

1. For each state, what is the relationship between the percentage of the population lacking healthcare and the percentage of the population living in poverty?

## Datasets

1. https://github.com/mjknj18/Demographic-Health-Risk-Analysis/blob/master/assets/data/data.csv

## Tasks

1. Import the data from the CSV file.
2. Set the locations and ranges for the x and y axes.
3. Plot the x and y axes.
4. Set the coordinates and dimensions for the circles representing the data for each state.
5. Plot the circles representing the data for each state.
6. Add a text label of state abbreviation to each circle for identification purposes.
